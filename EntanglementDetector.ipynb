    "## Introduction\n",
    "This page aims to give an intuitive (ie. non-rigorous) introduction to quantum entanglement in system of qubits, at a late-highschool level. It starts off with some background info on what entanglement is, and how it comes about. Then, a program is presented that can detect quantum entanglement an arbitrarily-sized system of qubits, along with an explanation for what is going on in the code.\n",

    "### What are Quantum States?\n",
    "In the quantum world, all particles behave as waves, and are therefore described by wavefunctions. A wavefunction is a mathematical function that describes the wave - think of f(x)=sin(x)). These wavefunctions are solutions to the __Schrodinger Wave Equation__, which is a partial differential equation. We say \"solutions\" (as in plural) because usually there are many wavefunctions that satisfy the SWE for a given particle. Due to the nature of linear differential equations (of which the SWE is an example), a __linear combination__ of any set of wavefunctions is also a solution to the SWE, and therefore also a wavefunction.<sup>1</sup> The \"state\" of a quantum particle is the specific linear combination of wavefunctions that describes it.<sup>2</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "<sup>1</sup>A \"linear combination\" means taking a set of things, multiplying each by a coefficient, and adding them up. Saying I have \"3 apples plus 2 pears\" is to say I have a linear combination of apples and pears.\n",
    "<sup>2</sup>The coefficients we use in the linear combination can be complex numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Developing a Mathematical Framework\n",
    "So far, we know that linear combinations of wavefunctions are also wavefunctions. Thanfully, there's a whole field of math that studies things that behave like this, called linear algebra. Linear algebra tells us that in the case of quantum states, we can describe all wavefunctions as being some linear combination of a set of fundamental states - so called __basis states__. If we can find the basis states for a system, we can describe all the other states just by adding up the basis states in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very abstract and powerful concept. With it, we can do a lot of thinking about quantum mechanics without every having to solve the SWE. We can just say that whatever the solutions to the SWE are, they can all be described using _some_ set of basis states.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application to Quantum Computing\n",
    "Classical computers use tiny switches called __bits__ to store and manipulate information. A given bit, like a light switch, can be in one of two states. On or off, which we'll call the |1⟩ and |0⟩ states respectively (Note: The |x⟩ notation is a staple of quantum mechanics. For now, you can just read |x⟩ as \"state x\"). With enough bits, you could encode a lot of information. For example, every letter in the alphabet can be encoded as a specific sequence of |1⟩'s and |0⟩'s using 8 bits. Now imagine what you could do with one gigabyte of RAM, which has 8*10^9 bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computers also use tiny \"switches\" called qubits (QUantum-BIT), which also have 2 separate states available to them. Like normal bits, we can call one of them |0⟩ and the other |1⟩. But, if we take the |1⟩ and |0⟩ states to be our basis, any linear combination of the |1⟩ and |0⟩ states is also a valid state. Therefore, the qubit can (conceptually) also be in the state 0.5|1⟩ + 0.5|0⟩<sup>2</sup>. Clearly, a single qubit can hold a lot more information than a single bit, which is what gives quantum computers their power. But what about when we have collections of qubits?\n",
    "\n",
    "<sup>2</sup>To be accurate, a true quantum state requires that the squares of the coefficients sum to 1 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function#Normalization_condition. Since 0.5^2+0.5^2=0.5 and not 1, this is not a true quantum state, but it would be if we multiplied both coefficeints by 2/sqrt(2)). Nevertheless, this can be overlooked for the conceptual understanding we're going for here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Cubits and Entanglement\n",
    "If we have a system of 2 *classical bits*, we can describe the possible states of the paired system in words. We can have both bits be \"on\", the first \"off\", and the second \"on\", the first \"on\" and the second \"off\", of both \"off\". Using our notation, we could write these 4 possible states as |00⟩, |01⟩, |10⟩, and |11⟩ respectively. No matter which of these 4 states the overall system is in, we can always break it down in terms of the states of the individual systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a set of 2 *qubits* instead, these 4 states are also valid, but just like before we can treat them as a basis set and any combination of these 4 is also a valid state. This sounds straightforward enough, but it leads to a very strange behaviour that has no parallel in classical physics - entanglement. This is what happens when we pick a combination of basis states such that the overall system cannot be described as a product of the individual qubits' states. For example, consider the system state |00⟩ + |01⟩. This system is not entangled, since we can write this as a product of 2 single-qubit states, namely ( |0⟩ ) x ( |0⟩ + |1⟩ ) (Hint: Multiply this out and use the rule |x⟩ x |y⟩ = |xy⟩). The state |00⟩ + |11⟩, however, is entangled."

    "## The Code\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "To detect if a given quantum state is entangled, all we have to do is prove that the state cannot be written as a product of individual qubit states. Keeping things general, we can write the following for a system state which is *not* entangled:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>A|00⟩ + B|01⟩ + C|10⟩ + D|11⟩ = ( a<sub>1</sub>|0⟩ + b<sub>1</sub>|1⟩ ) x ( a<sub>2</sub>|0⟩ + b<sub>2</sub>|1⟩ )</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplying this out and simplifying:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>A|00⟩ + B|01⟩ + C|10⟩ + D|11⟩ = a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>2</sub>|00⟩ + a<sub>1</sub>b<sub>2</sub>|01⟩ + b<sub>1</sub>a<sub>2</sub>|10⟩ + b<sub>1</sub>b<sub>2</sub>|11⟩</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this true, the coefficients on each vector on the left-hand side must equal the coefficients of the same vector on the right-hand side:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>A = a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>2</center>\n",
    "<center>B = a<sub>1</sub>b<sub>2</center>\n",
    "<center>C = b<sub>1</sub>a<sub>2</center>\n",
    "<center>D = b<sub>1</sub>b<sub>2</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, since we're giving this to a computer to solve, we can write this in the standard form of a root-finding problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>2</sub> - A = 0</center>\n",
    "<center>a<sub>1</sub>b<sub>2</sub> - B = 0</center>\n",
    "<center>b<sub>1</sub>a<sub>2</sub> - C = 0</center>\n",
    "<center>b<sub>1</sub>b<sub>2</sub> - D = 0</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we can find a set of numbers a<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, and b<sub>2</sub> that solves all of these equations at once, then it means that we can write our system state as the product of 2 states. Since this set of numbers may or may not exist, our best bet is to minimize the left-hand-side of each of those equations above, and see if the minimum is 0. From here, functions in the scipy library will take care of the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the Code\n",
    "To use the code, all you need to do is run the cell below, then input three things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The number of qubits you're interested in testing\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Whether you want to input the query state as a vector (i.e. using the coefficients on the |00⟩, |01⟩, |10⟩, and |00⟩ bases, as discussed above) OR as a density matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The vector coefficients or matrix elements of the query state.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: Normalization is calculated automatically, so you just need to input any normalization constants. if this doesn't make any sense, see footnote <sup>1</sup> under \"Application to Quantum Computing\". "
