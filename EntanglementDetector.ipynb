    "### What are Quantum States?\n",
    "In the quantum world, all particles behave as waves, and are therefore described by wavefunctions. This is a mathematical function that describes the wave - think of f(x)=sin(x)). These wavefunctions are solutions to the __Schrodinger Wave Equation__, which is a partial differential equation. We say \"solutions\" (as in plural) because usually there are many wavefunctions that satisfy the SWE for a given particle. Due to the nature of linear differential equations (of which the SWE is an example), a __linear combination__ of any set of wavefunctions is also a solution to the SWE, and therefore also a wavefunction. The \"state\" of a quantum particle is the specific linear combination of wavefunctions that describes it's state.\n",

    "### Developing a Mathematical Framework\n",
    "So far, we know that linear combinations of wavefunctions are also wavefunctions. Thanfully, there's a whole field of math that studies things that behave like this, called linear algebra.\n"
